MOVE CREATE AND UPDATE VALIDATION TO REMINDER DATA
LOOK INTO MOVING VALIDATION LOGIC INTO RULES

CreateOrUpdateReminderAction & CreateOrUpdateReminderValidation:
    I think it would be better to break these out into separate actions/validations for Create and Update. Any shared logic can be pulled up and re-used.

DEBUG AND ERROR INFORMATION:
    Make sure this isn't exposed on production. Right now it is.

TAGS:
    Allow adding tags to categorise reminders

NOTIFICATIONS:
    Record notifications in a new table. Things like reminder added, updated, archived and also for when reminders are due. Notification types could be 'reminder', 'created', 'updated', 'deleted'.

FAVORITES/PINNING:
    Allow favoriting/pinning reminders. Click on the heart icon in sidebar to view these.

CHOOSE REMINDER CHANNELS:
    Allow Users to Edit their Email address and add Telegram, SMS and possibly WhatsApp channels in the future. Perhaps even Messenger/Twitter DM?

ADD EXTRA DATA TO THE MESSAGE THAT IS SENT WITH EACH REMINDER:
    Send a link to the reminder. When sending out reminder, perhaps add a link to open up the reminder in the app too? This will rely on saving destination to the session as will most likely be redirected to Login page so will want to redirect to the Reminder on successful login.

GIVE REMINDERS A SUBJECT:
    Allow adding a subject to reminders. This could be useful if you want the body to have a lot of info on a given subject.
    e.g. Laravel DDD as subject then body full of notes and links related to the subject.

LOOK INTO QUEUEING TASKS:
    I think this is needed urgently so that the process doesn't need to wait on lengthy processes like sending email.
    Beanstalkd seems to be good: 
    Main site: https://beanstalkd.github.io/
    Client list: https://github.com/beanstalkd/beanstalkd/wiki/Client-Libraries
    Simple client: https://github.com/mariuswilms/beanstalk/blob/master/src/Client.php

DELETE & RESTORE:
    Allow users to view a list of archived reminders and restore or completely delete them (ireversible).

DATESSUPPORT:
    Domain\Dates\DatesSupport just doesn't seem right. All those static functions can't be good. Perhaps break out into DaysSupport, DatesSupport, MonthsSupport, YearsSupport and TimesSupport and remove the static-ness of the functions.

REDIRECT TO INTENDED PAGE:
    If user tries to view a specific page, but is redirected (e.g. to login) then I would like to be able to redirect them back to their intended page after performing the required action (e.g. log in).

REMEMBER ME:
    Keep a user logged in. See how Laravel does this.

LOGGING SERVICE:
    Bring in a logging service to log when reminders are sent and updated etc. in SendReminders.
